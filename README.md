This is an updated version of the original [OrganicModelBuilder](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/organic-model-builder.63023/). **For more info about the plugin please visit the original spigot page.**

It has a whole new code architecture for maintaining, although the core (math and stuff) remained the same.
