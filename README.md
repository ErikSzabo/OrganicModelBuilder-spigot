# Organic Model Builder 1.16.5

This is an updated version of the original [OrganicModelBuilder](https://github.com/ErikSzabo/OrganicModelBuilder-mc-1.16.5.git). 
At first the only goal was to make it work on spigot 1.16.5 with 
the newest wordledit or FAWE plugin, but I decided to add new 
features to it, like tab completion, and a config file with translatable 
messages and stuff. Code also needs some refactoring to increase maintainability and readability.
